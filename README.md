# Partnering with Cornerstone Solutions
### *Your Business, Automated. Your Time, Reclaimed.*

At **Cornerstone Solutions**, we don't just build websites; we build the **Cornerstone Engine**. We bridge the gap between "being busy" and "being profitable" by automating the repetitive tasks that keep you away from your customers.

## 🏗️ The Cornerstone Engine
We provide a centralized automation hub that connects your customer touchpoints into a single, high-performance system.

### **Our Core 4 "Instant-Win" Features**
When you partner with us, we deploy four primary systems designed to pay for themselves by capturing lost revenue:

#### 1. Missed Call Text-Back (The Revenue Saver)
* **The Gap:** 62% of small business calls go unanswered. Usually, those leads call your competitor immediately.
* **The Engine:** Our system detects a missed call and instantly sends a professional text: *"Hi! This is [Business Name], sorry we missed you. How can we help?"* It saves the lead before they hang up.

#### 2. Automated 5-Star Reviews (The Reputation Builder)
* **The Gap:** Happy customers forget to leave reviews, but reviews are what drive your Google ranking.
* **The Engine:** We trigger a polite review request via SMS the moment a job is finished, skyrocketing your local trust and visibility.

#### 3. Referral System (The Growth Multiplier)
* **The Gap:** Word-of-mouth is your best lead source, but it’s hard to track and encourage.
* **The Engine:** We build a digital referral system that rewards your current customers for bringing you new ones, creating a self-sustaining growth loop.

#### 4. Return Discounts (The Loyalty Logic)
* **The Gap:** It costs 5x more to find a new customer than to keep an old one.
* **The Engine:** Our system tracks customer history and automatically sends "We Miss You" offers to drive repeat business during slow seasons.

## 📱 Professional Management
You don’t need to be a tech expert to run this. We provide a sleek **Mobile App** and **Web Interface** where you can:

* **Unified Inbox:** View every text, email, and social message in one place.
* **Lead Tracking:** See exactly how many leads the Engine captured today.
* **Quick Actions:** Request reviews and send discount codes with a single tap.

## 🤝 The Partnership Promise
We act as your **External IT Architects**. We handle the "pipes and wires" of the software so you can focus on the craftsmanship of your business.
